# Intel-Image-Classification
Last summer during TURC research at the University of Tulsa for a few days we experimented with designing different convolutional architectures for neural nets to classify the Intel Image Dataset : a labeled multiclass image dataset 
- Objective: Design a Convolutional Architecture for a NN to classify the dataset
- Dataset: [Intel Image Dataset provided via Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/tasks)
-The Code: Is provided in this repository and also through Google Colab  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N2IgM66HvkaaXIE4qzgQwwkT6_4U19pJ?usp=sharing)
- **If you run the code in Google Colab you will need to save the dataset to your drive**: the reason for this is that if the script were to attempt to upload a local copy 
of the dataset every time it ran it would take forever! Google drive has an efficient file system which enables quick access by Google Colab's Virtual Machine (i.e the data never left a google server so data and computational resources are in one spot ... and not traversing the internet slowly! )
